## Purpose

Whole-body PET imaging plays an essential role in cancer diagnosis and treatment but suffers from low image quality. Traditional deep learning-based denoising methods work well for a specific acquisition but are less effective in handling diverse PET protocols. In this study, we proposed and validated a 3D Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (3D DDPM) as a robust and universal solution for whole-body PET image denoising. 

## Method

</p>
The proposed 3D DDPM gradually injected noise into the images during the forward diffusion phase, allowing the model to learn to reconstruct the clean data during the reverse diffusion process. A 3D convolutional network was trained using high-quality data from the Biograph Vision Quadra PET/CT scanner to generate the score function, enabling the model to capture accurate PET distribution information extracted from the total-body datasets. The trained 3D DDPM was evaluated on datasets from four scanners, four tracer types, and six dose levels representing a broad spectrum of clinical scenarios.

## Result

</p>
The proposed 3D DDPM consistently outperformed 2D DDPM, 3D UNet, and 3D GAN, demonstrating its superior denoising performance across all tested conditions. Additionally, the modelâ€™s uncertainty maps exhibited lower variance, reflecting its higher confidence in its outputs.  

## Installation
### Step 1: Clone the Repository

    git clone https://github.com/Miche11eU/PET-Image-Denoising-Using-3D-Diffusion-Model.git
    cd PET-Image-Denoising-Using-3D-Diffusion-Model

### Step 2: Create and activate the conda environment from the environment.yml file:

    conda env create -f environment.yml
    conda activate PET-3D-DDPM

### Step 3: Download Pre-trained Models
Download the pre-trained model files and place them into the `./checkpoint/` folder.

## Testing

### Data Preparation

Before running the denoising script, modify the `load_data_for_worker` function in `./scripts/test.py` to align with your data format and dimensions. This function is responsible for loading your low-dose PET data into the model.

### Running the Denoising Script

We provide a shell script `test_DDPM_3d_mpi.sh` to facilitate the testing process.

#### Usage

- `--base_samples`: Path to the `.npz` files containing your low-dose PET images.
- `--num_samples`: Total number of samples you wish to process.
- `-n`: Number of GPUs to utilize for parallel processing.
- `--save_dir`: Path to the directory where you want to save the denoised images.
