## Purpose

Whole-body PET imaging plays an essential role in cancer diagnosis and treatment but suffers from low image quality. Traditional deep learning-based denoising methods work well for a specific acquisition but are less effective in handling diverse PET protocols. In this study, we proposed and validated a 3D Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (3D DDPM) as a robust and universal solution for whole-body PET image denoising. 

## Method

</p>
The proposed 3D DDPM gradually injects noise into the images during the forward diffusion phase, allowing the model to learn to reconstruct the clean data during the reverse diffusion process. A 3D convolutional network was trained using high-quality data from the Biograph Vision Quadra PET/CT scanner to generate the score function, enabling the model to capture accurate PET distribution information extracted from the total-body datasets. The trained 3D DDPM was evaluated on datasets from four scanners, four tracer types, and six dose levels representing a broad spectrum of clinical scenarios.

## Result

</p>
The proposed 3D DDPM consistently outperformed 2D DDPM, 3D UNet, and 3D GAN, demonstrating its superior denoising performance across all tested conditions. Additionally, the modelâ€™s uncertainty maps exhibited lower variance, reflecting its higher confidence in its outputs.
